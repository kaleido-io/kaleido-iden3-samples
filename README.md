# Kaleido Tutorials for Polygon ID and the iden3 protocol

There are two versions:

- v1: based on the iden3 stack as of December 2022. Even though some of the components in the stack have been updated to support the Polygon ID platform, such as the circuits for the zero knowledge proofs, it's still a good source of information on the basics of the iden3 protocol. It's also easier to set up because it's all based on command line based programs

- v2: based on the Polygon ID release 1.0 beta 3. It uses microservices built with the Polygon ID code to illustrate a more realistic workflow interactions between the issuer, the holder wallet and the verifier.
